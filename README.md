# RGBcolorgame
this is a small Javascript app that asks you to guess which of the six colors corresponds to the RGB code in the header
The ideea behind it is very simple
i used just HTML JavaScript and css
i generated 3 random numbers beween 0 and 255 added them togather as a RGB code and pushed them in a colors array
